## Notes

From [Book 1]:

> S3E is short for Segundo Embedded Execution Environment and this is the lowest
> layer of the Marmalade SDK. This naming convention was adopted by the SDK
> during its early days of development, and it remains to this day. As you will
> see later in this book, there are a great many APIs that are prefixed with
> this name.
