# Marmalade SDK modding

Some misc. utilities made while modding games made with the Marmalade SDK. You can probably find better tools online.

## Tools

* `dzextract.py`: Tries to extract a `.dz` archive and generate a DZip configuration file. There is only limited support ATM, so using the official `dzip.exe` is recommended.
* `disable_sig_check.py`: Really basic script to patch out signature verification. Only works with Marmalade loader v4.40.0.
* `dump_s3e_header.py`: Basic dump of an s3e file header.
